# Swatchhta Bot

Residents of developing countries, particularly the urban poor, are disproportionately affected by unsustainable garbage management. Over 90% of waste in low-income countries is often disposed of in unregulated dumps or openly burned. These activities have major implications for health, safety, and the environment. Hence, managing waste properly is essential for building sustainable and livable cities. Normally most of the unused and waste materials are found to be electronics, wet, dry etc. These materials can be recycled for further use. The primary aim of the proposed work is to segregate materials such as metals, wet, and dry.

## Project Overview

Keeping the above scenario in mind, in eYRC 2022-23 we present the theme Swatchhta Bot (SB), as the name suggests this comprises a robot deployed to collect different types of wastes and dispose them into separate bins. The robot swiftly navigates through the different cities to collect segregated waste and then goes to the dumping area to dispose of them in different bins.

In this theme, the team builds the SB Bot for deployment on an arena which is an abstraction of a Smart City. The brain of the robot is powered by an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that controls its sensors, actuators, and pick-place mechanism.

## Challenges and Learnings

Major challenges and learnings in this theme include building the Swatchhta Bot from scratch using an FPGA. This FPGA-based robot is able to traverse the arena, sense the environment, and collect and dispose of the waste. It uses wired and wireless communication techniques. This theme helps teams build a sophisticated architecture using Verilog HDL to unveil the powerful parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs.

### Key Learnings:
- FPGA
- C
- Verilog
- CPU Architecture
- Build-a-Bot
- Parallel Processing
- Serial Communication
